# stmdsp
Code for an STM32-based DSP device.

**Goals:**
* Read +/- 5V signal(s) off of at least one pin
* Send +/- 5V signal(s) off of at least one pin
* Perform DSP calculations (e.g. filtering) on-device
* Communicate with a computer program to allow for the reading, writing, and transformation of signals.

See the wiki for pages on each of these goals.
